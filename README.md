# Dotfiles

Configurations for some of my applications.

## ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️

**I WILL NOT** accept **any** pull request. Why?

This is not really my dotfiles. My actual dotfiles are setted up using Nix [here](https://github.com/TomAintAround/nixos-configs). If you are using NixOS, I recommend seeing that repository instead. Every time I update one of my configurations in that repository, I also make changes here, but sometimes without testing them at all. I strongly advise you to not blindly copy these configurations and study them before using them.
